            <p>
              In the age of rapid advancements in artificial intelligence,
              distinguishing between human-authored content and AI-generated
              text has become an important challenge. Our project addresses this
              issue by developing a robust detection system that can accurately
              differentiate between texts written by humans and those generated
              by AI models.
            </p>
            <p>
              Using advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques and
              machine learning algorithms, we analyze key linguistic features,
              sentence structures, and writing patterns that reveal the source
              of the text. This system is especially valuable for ensuring
              academic integrity, identifying machine-generated content in
              educational and professional settings, and maintaining the
              authenticity of written work in various domains.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our solution is designed to support educators, researchers, and
              content creators in protecting intellectual property and upholding
              the quality of human-authored work, while promoting responsible
              use of AI technologies.
